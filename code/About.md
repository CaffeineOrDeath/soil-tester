# About

Countries around the world are struggling to meet the demands of their people.
They require far more food than they can produce and require imports. We know
this from looking at the data showing an ever growing population boom that is
affecting, not only third world nations, but many first world as well.
Starvation and famine have become a serious problem and I want to solve that
problem for the world. Even if the richest people could buy the food, there is
not enough of it.  

So what do we do? Well, we need to know what nutrients are in the soil to begin
with. This will allow us to figure out which crops can flourish. For example, a
common plant that is hardy in low nutrient and draught resistant, Abelmoschus
Esculentus. commonly known as Okra. Okra also has a lot of health benefits,
especially in the digestive system. 

So what can we do to help people grow the right food for their soils?

## Soil Testing

The basic steps for soil testing include:  
1. collect soil to test  
2. dry soil to remove all moisture (this will in affect, retain the nutrients)  
3. dried soil is mixed with an extractant (covered later)  
4. liquid is extracted and tested to check the nutrient contents  
5. results are given a value between high and low (class A, B ,C)  

## Extractant

There are many types of extractants. The most common one (used by UF/IFAS) is
Mehlich-3. A common mixture (found readily) is:  
 0.073M Sodium Acetate  
+0.520M  acetic acid  
+0.001M diethylenetriacrmineacetic acid  
Buffer the mix to a pH of 4.8  

There are other mixtures, however I do not, at this time, have enough
information to declare them. 

## Idea

The idea of this project is quite simple. Devise a machine(s) that can extract
the soil and put it in a vial (think ice extraction). Doing this, means any
minerals in a typical collection bucket (whether reused or left standing) cannot
contaminate the results, thus leading to a more accurate test. 

From the collection vial, it can be handled and placed into another machine, if
not self contatined, where a small needle will pierce the top and inject
extractant. The needle will retract and the machine will begin to spin,
centrifuge. This will drop all of the solids out of suspension and allow the
needle to retrieve the fluid sample.

This fluid will then be extracted and flown through sterile tubing across
several sensors. These sensors can include, but are not limited to, 
photo-optics, probes that lead to another machine, or even drops placed on
litmus paper. 

This method then allows for for easy replacement/cleaning. If cleaning the
equipment, an autoclave would be ideal. Follow that with a vaccum chamber to
ensure it stays clean. ISO rooms would be ideal, but may fall out of the realm
of plausability, quickly.

## Planning

While I have the programming knowledge to achieve most of this (as well as some
development boards lying around), I do not know enough about this topic to begin
diving into it. I will, however, begin on the mechanical parts while awaiting
information from a local college and also from my local Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS). As today, 28-09-2024 (Saturday), they are closed.
So Monday (30-09-2024) emails will go out to njaes.rutgers.edu and 
[local NRCS person]@usda.gov for more information.
