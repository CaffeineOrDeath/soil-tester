# Analysis System

The analysis system ill be composed of several external systems to check what
the composition is. The challenge here, is getting the right materials to not
interact or interfere with the testing solution or the contents thereof.

## Planning

The analysis system is directly connected to the [pump system](../pump/pump.md).
When the pump system is activated, it passes the solution to the analysis and is
flown to the sensors.
