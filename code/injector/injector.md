# Injector System

This systems is rather simple. Under pneaumatic pressure, a tiny needle will
pierce the container and inject the extractant. The injector will retract, and
the centrigufe will begin to spin. Once done, a longer needle will be depressed
back into the solution and will extract all of the fluid. There will be a small
filter to ensure no solids are extracted.

## Multiple Samples

Adding a data structure to create a vial counter will be necessary. This will
ensure that each container is injected and extracted. However, taking into
account several containers for extraction, another method will be required to either
change extraction tubes when passing the solution to a sensor or bringing the
sensor to the fluid and then cleaning the sensors. Which sounds much more
simplistic and effective.
