I cannot find anything on how the test, itself, is conducted other than the few generic steps.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Get a soil sample (6"{} depth is recommended)
\item Mix with extractant solution (dependent on type of test)
\item Remove the solids
\item Test the extracted solution
\item Return solution to the sample
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

I know this is overly simplified as most people do not need to know the process. What kind of testing is done? How are the tests conducted? What machine(s), if any, are used?

Then, I started by looking into what solutions are used to extract the nutrient content for testing. I found a simple mixture (which leads me to believe that it is for limited testing), Mehlich-\/3, Mehlich-\/1 and a few others. Can you clarify, for me\+: which solution is used, and what they test for?
