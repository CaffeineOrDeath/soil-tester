This systems is rather simple. Under pneaumatic pressure, a tiny needle will pierce the container and inject the extractant. The injector will retract, and the centrigufe will begin to spin. Once done, a longer needle will be depressed back into the solution and will extract all of the fluid. There will be a small filter to ensure no solids are extracted.\hypertarget{md_soil_2code_2injector_2injector_autotoc_md18}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Multiple Samples}{Multiple Samples}}\label{md_soil_2code_2injector_2injector_autotoc_md18}
Adding a data structure to create a vial counter will be necessary. This will ensure that each container is injected and extracted. However, taking into account several containers for extraction, another method will be required to either change extraction tubes when passing the solution to a sensor or bringing the sensor to the fluid and then cleaning the sensors. Which sounds much more simplistic and effective.
