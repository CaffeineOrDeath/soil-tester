The pump system will be a simple water pump. Low pressure, cheap power requirements. The idea here is one of two materials\+: stainless steel or a peristaltic pump. One is corrosion resistant, the other can have the hose replaced (cheaper in the long run).

The goal with the pump system is be as lightweight as possible while stuill being durable enough to last a few uses or be easy to maintain. Replace rollers or tubing instead of need to replace the whole pump system.\hypertarget{md_soil_2code_2pump_2pump_autotoc_md21}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Pump Type}{Pump Type}}\label{md_soil_2code_2pump_2pump_autotoc_md21}
From all of the research, I could only find two (2) options suitable for this use case. Either a stainless steel pump to avoid corrosion and reduce maintance or a peristaltic pump with anti-\/corrosive tubing. The problem with this is that it needs to be flexible enough to handle repeated presure.\hypertarget{md_soil_2code_2pump_2pump_autotoc_md22}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Stainless Steel Pump}{Stainless Steel Pump}}\label{md_soil_2code_2pump_2pump_autotoc_md22}
These pumps are naturally corrosive resitant. However, this adds significant weight to the machine and would make it near impossible to move alone. The only alternative to this method would be to use some type of motorized motion. At that point, it would be more simple to code up a full computer system with eyes. Not enough to be AI, but enough to do the job.

The second problem with stainless pumps, is the cost. Starting at around \$350(\+USD), more than what the machine should cost in total. Even the smallest version, is around \$100(\+USD).

The third issue, is voltage requirement. Even a 1 phase stailess steel pump requires 110V/50\+Hz. I\textquotesingle{}m not using mains voltage, so this is not a viable option at this time.\hypertarget{md_soil_2code_2pump_2pump_autotoc_md23}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Peristaltic Pump}{Peristaltic Pump}}\label{md_soil_2code_2pump_2pump_autotoc_md23}
Lightweight, cheap to purchase, but not quite fitting what is required. These pumps are relatively cheap. Around \$12(\+USD) for a 12v dosing pump (medical use). Once again, I don\textquotesingle{}t need 12v. A small DC motor, should work just fine. I have some basic hobby DC motors as well a 5v smart motor (CZ021-\/60028). I need to find the data sheet for this motor to see what min-\/max settings it has.

Pair a DC motor with bearings (for PoC, skateboard bearings) as the rollers since I do not have the wheels for this. Solid rubber wheels, like a 3D printer has, should be sufficient for this project.\hypertarget{md_soil_2code_2pump_2pump_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Addendum}{Addendum}}\label{md_soil_2code_2pump_2pump_autotoc_md24}
On top of those items, something is needed for the housing to hold the bearings in place. For PoC, a 3D printed housing system, is probebly the best idea. Clips together from both sides to make sure they fit. free\+CAD for the design software.
