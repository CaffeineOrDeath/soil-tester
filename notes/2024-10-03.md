# Notes - Day 4(?)


I started a notes section as to not make each individual sections readme larger
than it needs to be. I'm going to try to keep these by date so only what is done
is covered.

what they test for.

### Pump System

The model is coming along. It's painful to keep measuring to make sure its
accurate. Motor, housing and rollers are done. I still need to add a door for
replacing parts and mounting the motor. Other than that, the pump should be
ready for print shortly after. 

### Interrupts

These are now more modular. I still need to add the rest of the INTs for future
projects.
