# Notes 4

## Change Log

Updated interrupts (further changes will be required)  
Added logging system (not tested)  

## Build

Still successful, though is not functional  
No testing has been performed

## Planning Ahead

Removal of INTs[] in sys_init()  
Add System[] to sys_init() (akin to how SDL handles theirs)  
ISR implementation to ensure BADISR_vector is handled
