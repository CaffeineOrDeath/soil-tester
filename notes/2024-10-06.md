# Notes 2

## Day 7

I lost track of the days in the beginning and remembered I could check GitHub for
when it was first pushed. It was 7 days ago... 

## Errors

CMake is... complicated. I figured out some of the compilation problems. I still
ahve a couple left to get it building as it stands. If you run into CMake
problems such as things like "device type not defined" (avr-libc), make sure
you set `-mmc=<your-device>` is being set in the `CMakeLists.txt` that is
building the library or have a single monsterous file that handles the building
of it.

As of right now, I have two (2) more `undeclared vars` when they were supposed
to be globals from avr. It's more likely that I missed or misunderstood something when writing
it.
