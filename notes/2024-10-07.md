# Notes 3

## Errors

All errors are handled as of now and we have a successful build. Took a while as
CMake is a pain, however this also means, going forward, that most build
problems should be adding flags, includes, or just bad code...

## Build 2

Interrupt system is passing data correctly, so far. Tomorrow will be setting up
a bread board to test with a button. If all goes well, it's full steam ahead. 
The other systems will require procuring some materials, so I do not know how
I'll go about testing them.
